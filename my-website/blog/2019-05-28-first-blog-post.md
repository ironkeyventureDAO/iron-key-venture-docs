Angel investing isn't for everyone.
And that's a good thing.

<!-- truncate -->

## People who should become angels:

1. **Operators who have built or scaled companies.** They understand execution, timing, and why most startups actually fail.

2. **Finance professionals who understand risk and capital allocation.** They already think in portfolios, not emotions.

3. **People who can think long term.** Venture rewards patience and discipline more than speed.

## People who shouldn't:

1. **Anyone chasing quick returns.** Angel investing is illiquid and rarely predictable.

2. **Anyone investing for status or proximity.** If the goal is being seen instead of building, outcomes usually suffer.
