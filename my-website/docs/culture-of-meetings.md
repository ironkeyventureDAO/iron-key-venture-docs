# Culture of Meetings

Maintaining effective meeting standards is vital for project momentum as a fully virtual organization. We communicate often to ensure all team members are on the same page and aware of individual next steps. Despite the intensity of our work, we promote a relaxed meeting atmosphere in which people feel comfortable and eager to collaborate.
