# Iron Key Ventures

:::tip Investment Thesis
💡 **INVESTMENT THESIS: Iron Key is looking to invest in Web3 projects and startups that are accelerating blockchain adoption by consumers and enterprises.**
:::

Iron Key is an investment ecosystem focused on liquid and venture opportunities in emerging technology. We are keenly interested in Pre-Seed and seed-stage Web3 / AI startups that emphasize enterprise adoption and consumer enablement of utility-driven digital assets. Our mission is to support innovative projects that can bring substantial value to the blockchain ecosystem.

To foster innovation and growth, we operate a dedicated blockchain innovation lab. This lab incubates select startups within the Web3 infrastructure space, providing them with the resources and guidance needed to succeed. Our hands-on approach ensures that promising projects have the support they need to navigate the complexities of the crypto world.

Iron Key is backed by a robust network of over 200 Limited Partners (LPs) from across the globe. This diverse and engaged community enables us to deploy more than $1 million annually into various projects, ensuring we can make meaningful investments that drive the industry forward.

Iron Key aims to catalyze groundbreaking developments in the crypto and blockchain sectors by combining financial support with strategic guidance. We are committed to identifying and nurturing the next wave of disruptive technologies that will shape the future of digital assets.

## Mission

Iron Key's mission is to build a new venture investment model based on the principles of Web3 and decentralization. We use the legal mechanics of crowdfunding to turn communities into syndicates and vice versa. We use this standard to convert syndicates into Iron Key Venture DAO participants effectively.

## Vision

Iron Key brings together a vetted network of venture professionals to invest through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. Member contributions are rewarded in points for sourcing deal flow, performing diligence, and investing, while investors can tap into the network directly to receive diligence by spending tokens. This new model better aligns incentives to produce and share diligence, effectively crowdsourcing the VC investing process.
