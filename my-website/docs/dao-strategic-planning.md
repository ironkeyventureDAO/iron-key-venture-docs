# DAO Strategic Planning

:::tip Purpose
💡 **The purpose of this page is document, record, ideate, research, and manage strategic initiatives Iron Key will be pursuing.**
:::

Long-term strategic planning is crucial for a VentureDAO to ensure its longevity. By setting clear goals and a roadmap, the organization can navigate the rapidly changing landscape and stay aligned with its mission. Strategic planning allows for the identification of potential risks and opportunities, fostering proactive rather than reactive decision-making. It also ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and that all members are working towards common objectives. Ultimately, a well-articulated long-term strategy helps in building a sustainable and resilient organization capable of achieving its vision.

:::tip Goal
🎯 **Goal:** help your entire team, organization, or company plan effectively to hit your hardest goals.

1. Start by laying out your [Planning Calendar](https://www.notion.so/9251f8092b87467295e8b5a1c97b6a89?pvs=21) to get everyone aligned on the who, what, and where for planning
2. Use Planning Deliverables to outline your priorities for the half that will be shared with teams; you can use a [mid-term strategy doc](https://www.notion.so/Notion-Mid-Term-Strategy-687400c3c1d14b489441cb954174e3fc?pvs=21) to describe why these are your priorities
3. Individual teams then fill out a [H1 Team Plan Template](https://www.notion.so/H1-Team-Plan-Template-36f37d1739634ba6b40989c13ef296a7?pvs=21), reflecting on what they want to achieve and how their work ladders up to objectives
4. This template makes use of a [Venture Strategic Initiatives](https://www.notion.so/0b92816d903d4b27ae54b19ec7d1806c?pvs=21) database to consolidate what teams are working on for easy review and connects this to company objectives
