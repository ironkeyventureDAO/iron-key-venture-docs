# Introduction

## 🔓 Unlocking the Future of Venture Investing

Iron Key brings together a vetted network of venture professionals to invest, learn, and earn through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. Member contributions are rewarded in tokens for sourcing deal flow, performing diligence, and more, while investors can tap into the network directly to receive diligence by spending tokens. This new model better aligns incentives to produce and share diligence, effectively crowdsourcing the VC investing process.

## 🗝️ From Iron Key Capital to Iron Key Venture DAO

Traditional financial services business models are too rigid and are not conducive to capturing the value from innovations inside the web3 ecosystem. This is why Iron Key Capital launched the Venture DAO, to crowdsource research, intelligence, and deal flow within early-stage crypto investing. Iron Key Venture DAO consists of web3 researchers, founders, and angel syndicates benefitting from shared deal flow and LPs.
