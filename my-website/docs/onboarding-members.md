# Onboarding Members

Currently, Iron Key is only accepting new members as Venture Fellows or Venture Partners.

Iron Key provides an easy, intuitive onboarding process that sets you up for success as a DAO contributor. You'll have immediate access to all the necessary information and resources—from deal flow to education materials—to hit the ground running.

Below is an overview of our interviewing process for Venture Fellows into the Fellow Program. First, you'll submit an application. Next, an interview is conducted. You'll either be accepted into the Venture Fellow Program or not. If accepted, you'll be invited to join the next cohort. Lastly, all applicants will confirm their place inside of the cohort.
