<summary><strong>Q: How Can Iron Key Help You?</strong></summary>

**Exclusive Deal Flow:**

Quality deal flow: Accessible only to our vetted investor community. We source and diligence hundreds of companies and invest in few (6-10 per year). You'll also have 100% control in building your own investment portfolio. You'd only invest in what you have firm conviction in.

Additionally, we're aligned with our Limited Partners (LPs). There's only 20% carry; we profit only when you do. There are no annual capital commitments. Even if you're not ready to invest, that is completely ok. You can come to see what great deal flow and world-class diligence look like.

**Iron Key Angel in-Residence(AIR) Program:**

You'll learn the angel investing/VC playbook. You can take your skills as an investor to the next level. Our angel/VC blueprint helps you refine, hone, and improve your investing skillset. You'd also gain hands-on deal experience. Iron Key Venture Fellows are admitted to our investment committee (IC). By working on real deal flow, you'd help us decide which deals we should invest in. Lastly, Iron Key shares up to 50% carry out on every syndicate with Program Fellows. Our carry share is best-in-class.

**Seeking Funding:**

If you're a founder in the Web3 vertical, we invest in **B2B2C Web3 infrastructure** focused on the enterprise adoption of utility-driven digital assets. The sectors we focus primarily on are **Protocols, Deep Tech, APIs, NFT infrastructure, AL/ML, Big Data, and IoT**. Our sweet spot investment stage is **Pre-Seed to Seed**. We're open to investing in deals in Latin America and Europe; however, we prefer to seek deals primarily in the US.

Additional deal criteria include Alpha product in use (no slideware/ pre-product), **$7M - $25M Post Money Valuation**, and **Technical Co-Founder Required**.
