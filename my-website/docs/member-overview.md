## How to Leverage Our Discord

### Discord

Discord is where deals are discussed and where Deal Champions are made. Our Deal Flow Pipeline funnels from Tally through Notion then into Discord. It operates as the community hub: an educational resource and home for all things venture.

This is a server open to EVERYONE seeking to learn about venture; however, all of our deals are contained in gated channels to ensure that Venture Fellows and Partners are free to discuss all deals in confidence with committed investors and partners.

Our Deal Flow War Room serves as a tool for quick communication and deal execution.
